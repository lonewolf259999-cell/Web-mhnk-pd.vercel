/* Site-wide admin access.

   This replaced the ADMIN_PIN session. The gate is now the Discord id
   allowlist the sheet holds for /rostermanage (NamePD!AA2/AB2), so every write
   is attributable to an account and access is taken away by editing one cell
   rather than by changing a code everyone shares and redistributing it.
   Nothing here authorises anything: the server re-reads the list on every
   call, and this only decides what the page bothers to draw.

   Two separate facts, deliberately. `allowed` is whether this account may
   edit; the stored flag is whether the person has switched editing on. The
   Discord session lasts a week, so without that second flag an admin would
   find edit controls on every page for days — which is the one thing the
   30-minute PIN session got right, by expiring. */
