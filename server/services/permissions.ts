/* Page access lists kept in the spreadsheet — a Discord id allowlist.

   /rostermanage used to be gated by ADMIN_PIN: one shared code that opened
   every admin endpoint at once, could not say who had used it, and had to be
   changed and redistributed to take access away from a single person. The gate
   is now the signed Discord session cookie plus a list of user ids held in the
   sheet, so access is granted or revoked by editing one cell and every write
   is attributable to a named account.

   The list is not a credential. Knowing an allowed id grants nothing, because
   the id has to come from a Discord login this server verified (see
   services/session.ts) — which is what makes a sheet other people can read a
   safe place to keep it. ADMIN_PIN never was.

   Read through the Sheets API rather than the GViz export on purpose: GViz is
   CDN-cached, so an id deleted from the sheet could keep working for minutes. */
